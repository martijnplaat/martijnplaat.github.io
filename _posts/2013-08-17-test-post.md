I read this tweet recently. 
Since I have my background in semantic technologies I have to admit that we can only leverage the power of the Internet when data is freely available for everyone and even more; computers should be able to interpret the meaning of this data. The web, as we notice today, holds data which is freely available but, the semantics of the data is still locked up in the back-end databases.
