I read this tweet recently. 

Since I have my background in semantic web technologies I have to say that we can only leverage the power of the web when data is freely available for everyone and even more; computers should be able to interpret the meaning of this data. The web, as we notice today, holds data which is freely available but, the semantics of the data is still locked up in our back-end databases. This lack of semantics on the web is not the point I want to make and is still a shortcoming of the web we hopefully overcome somewhere in the near future.

But, what we have accomplished, is a web of connected documents with open -freely available- data which could be indexed and analysed by search engines and advanced web applications. In my opinion there are two trends that threatens this powerful foundation.
