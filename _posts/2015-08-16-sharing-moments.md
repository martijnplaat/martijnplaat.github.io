It's august 16 2015,
the night before I will become a father of two girls, fraternal twins.
Writing is a beautiful way of sharing important moments.
A beautiful way of sharing stuff you like the most. 
Let other people know what is really beautiful in life.
This day I listened on my old fashioned turntable to some beautiful songs.

Bread - Everything I Own

This song has some sad words because he is singing to give up everything he owns
for getting back a particular girl in his life.

Well, this sad connotation is not the case in my life.
Just the opposite actually, because through these words I realised that 
by having two beautiful girls in my life, 
which I surely will love until the day I die, 
I will give up everything I own to make them happy. 
Exactly the way my parents did for me.
My dad once told me that the money he spend to let me study is equal to a nice 
second home in France. And just to remember, we were with three of us at home..

It's 22:07. Bedtime.
Tommorrow is the day my love is initiated in the hospital.
The day my life will never be the same.
